# SpectrumPY: Spectrum integration for Python with Jupyter Notebook examples

This project contains two python packages that expose Spectrum functionality for use within python environments. It also contains a folder containing two Jupyter notebooks that provide documentation for the packages and examples for how to use them.

python packages
***************
There are two python packages: spectrumpy and spectrumspatialpy. spectrumpy provides basic Spectrum exposure into python, including exposure of custom web services exposed from data flows. spectrumspatialpy wraps the web services from Spectrum Spatial for spatial data integration and mapping analysis. This is created as a separate package because it has dependencies that are not needed for other Spectrum integration use cases.

Jupyter notebooks
***************
There are three notebooks provided: [Spectrum Python Package - Jupyter Notebook](Spectrum%20Python%20Package%20-%20Jupyter%20Notebook.pdf), [Spectrum Spatial - Jupyter Notebook](Spectrum%20Spatial%20-%20Jupyter%20Notebook.pdf), and [Spectrum Python Setup - Jupyter Notebook](Spectrum%20Python%20Setup%20-%20Jupyter%20Notebook.pdf). The first two describe their respective python packages and the third provides installation and setup instructions.
